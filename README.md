# OBS Studio/MediaStar Pro Integration
Adds additional hotkey support to facilitate controlling OBS Studio with MediaStar Pro show control remote control. Currently it doesn't do much, only adding support for two new hotkeys. I may add additional functionality later. Who knows?

As this simply adds additional hotkey support, this script should work with most any remote, or directly from teh keyboard.

It adds the following hotkeys:
  * *next scene* - Advances to next scene. Does nothing if the last scene is currently active.
  * *previous scene* - Goes back to previous scene. Does nothing if the first scene is currently active.
  
## MediaStar Pro Usage
OBS works well with the standard MediaStar profile, as all the keypresses map to function keys.

The easiest way to set the hotkeys is to open the hotkey settings, place the cursos in the appropriate hotkey field, and hit the desired remote button.

## Notes
I am not affiliated with either OBS Studio or MediaStar Pro. I'm merely a user who wanted the two to work together better for my purposes. I'm making it available for anyone else who wants to use as well. So, if you're needs happen to align with mine, enjoy!
